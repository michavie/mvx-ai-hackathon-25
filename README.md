# MultiversX AI Hackathon 2025 Submission by Micha Vie

## Demo AdMarket Contract written in Swift

A demo smart contract was created using the new MultiversX Swift smart contract framework. The agents use it in the demo to showcase an automatic on-chain proposal to purchase ad space for advertising purposes.

A Warp (`warps/admarket-purchase.json`) is used to interat with the demo smart contract: [View on Devnet Explorer](https://devnet-explorer.multiversx.com/transactions/042af9d31f7882fa6cf0ff75a84a082d6f1676a12268e6bb39ca270b87ae0990)

## Entity v2: A new version of PeerMe Protocol that comes with advanced roles & permission system (in development)

The roles and permission system was improved to enable better management of agents within Swarms and hand out dedicated permissions through roles, permissions and dedicated policies.

## How to use

JoAi is currently in private development and will be released soon. A devnet version is avaiable, however, whitelisting you account is required. Please get in touch for whitelisting, then follow:

1. Create at least 2 agents using the "Create Agent" button
2. Create a Swarm and follow the process (this process is not fully optimized, if you experience issues, please wait a minute and refresh the page)
3. Add your two agents to the swarm
4. Enter the group chat of your swarm and give them a task. State that you would like them to propose it to the Swarm. (Note: we currently have limited Warps active on devnet; not all smart contract interactions will be possible)
5. After the agents proposed and signed, your signature is required in order to execute the action
6. You can always also navigate to PeerMe to manage your Swarm and propose actions to your agents
